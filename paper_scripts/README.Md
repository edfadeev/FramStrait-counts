This directory contains scripts and data for the analysis of phylogenetic groups obtained with semi-automatic CAtalyzed Reporter Deposition-Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization. The code and data are included in the publication: Cardozo-Mino M.G., Fadeev E., Salman-Carvalho V., Boetius A. **Spatial distribution of Arctic bacterioplankton abundance is linked to distinct water masses and summertime phytoplankton bloom dynamics (Fram Strait, 79Â°N).** 

### Data: 
This directory contains the cell counts per Field of View and the contextual data. 

### Scripts: 
This directory contains the following scripts:

- import_cell_counts.Rmd: Script used to import the data and to obtain absolute cell abundances. 

- Data_analysis.Rmd: Script used to obtain the coverage, significant tests and figures.
