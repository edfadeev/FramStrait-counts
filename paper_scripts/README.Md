This directory contains scripts and data for the analysis of phylogenetic groups obtained with semi-automatic CAtalyzed Reporter Deposition-Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization. The code and data are included in the publication: Cardozo M.G., Fadeev E., Salman-Carvalho V., Boetius A. **Extensive quantitative taxonomic characterization of Arctic pelagic microbial communities from the surface to the deep ocean in ice-covered and ice-free regions of the Fram Strait.** 

### Data: 
This directory contains the cell counts per Field of View and the contextual data. 

### Scripts: 
This directory contains the following scripts:

- Figures_and_statistics_by_EF_MC_05.08.19.R: Main script used to import the data and to obtain absolute and relative abundances in the different regions, including coverage of probes, and DAPI, distribution with depth, significance of groups between the regions, overview of phylogenetic groups by regions. 

- FISH_correlations.R: Correlation analysis.

- Figure3-Depth_profiles.R
